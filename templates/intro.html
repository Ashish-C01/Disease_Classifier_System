        <p>The project entitled Disease classification system is web application through which a patient can check if he/she has any of the diseases described below or not.</p>
            
            
            <p>This system can detect following diseases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pneumonia</li>
                <li>Liver disease</li>
            <li>Malaria</li>
            <li>Heart attack</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The main objective of this web application is to reduce the amount of time spent while waiting for the report.</p>
        <p>A right system can save a lot of money and also the time wasted while waiting for the report regarding the corresponding test.</p>

        <h4>Pneumonia detection</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>This module is used to detect if the patient has pneumonia or not</li>
        <li>Details about the model used for pneumonia detection</li>
        <li>We have used deep learning to classify images as infectd or not</li>
        <li>In this we have to give chest X-Ray as an input</li>

        <h3>Heart attack detection</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In this module the user can check if he/she has chances of getting heart attack or not</li>
        <li>k nearest neighbor algorithm has been used to train the model</li>
        <li>K-Nearest Neighbour is a Machine Learning algorithm based on Supervised Learning technique. K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.</li>
        <li>The model has 84.7% accuracy on training data and 91.80% accuracy on test data</li>
        <li>The recall of this model for detection is good</li> 
    </ul>
        <h3>Liver disease detection</h3>
