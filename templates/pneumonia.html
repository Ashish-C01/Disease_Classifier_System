         <h1 style="text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;">Pneumonia</h1>
         <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>
         <p>Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.
         </p>
         <p>Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination.Chest X-rays, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia</p>
         <h2>Symptoms</h2>
         <p>The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Cough, which may produce greenish, yellow or even bloody mucus</li>
             <li>Shortness of breath</li>
             <li>chest pain that’s worse when you breathe or cough</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Types of pneumonia</h2>
         <dl>
             <dt>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)</dt>
             <dd>This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay</dd>
             <dt>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)</dt>
             <dd>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia that’s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting.</dd>
             <dt>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)  </dt>
             <dd>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation breathing machines in hospitals</dd>

         <h2>Causes of pneumonia</h2>
         <dl>
             <dt>Bacterial Pneumonia</dt>
             <dd>Bacteria are the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases</dd>
             <dt>Viral Pneumonia</dt>
             <dd>In adults, viruses account for about one third of pneumonia cases, and in children for about 15% of them.</dd>
             <dt>Fungal Pneumonia</dt>
             <dd>Fungal pneumonia is uncommon, but occurs more commonly in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems.</dd>
